# Student Performace Exploration

## Dataset

The data consists of information regarding 1,000 student, including
parent education, ethnicity, ..etc. The dataset can be found in Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there was a strong spikes like values in the writing and reading exam that caught my attention. So we explored each variable how it affects the student performance and how to improve it. We found the most male are poor in reading and writing and that the preperation test improved overall the grades regarding your ethnicity or your gender. Which approximately  increased by 20%.
**Group A** is the most important thing that caught my attention of how the preperation test jumped all their grades. Which present to us that group A have bad studying enviroment or conditions make them have bad performance in their test. Because when they got the right preperation they catched up the rest of the groups.

We need also to clarify that the parental education doesn't effect the students performance comparing to the other values. It's hard work only that make the student more succefull.

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on just the influence of the four variables of the student performance
and leave out most of the intermediate derivations. I start by introducing the gender variable and how their performance in each math, reading, and writing test.
